# Property-Ownership Visualization (POV)

Understanding who is investing in real estate, and the patterns of their investments, is critical both for assessing the need for, and the effects of, policy interventions by governments, lenders, and non-profit community development organizations. 
This tool allows the user to explore and filter data in order to look for patterns of ownership in Manhattan and directly address on of the biggest challenges when one tries to identify these kind of patterns: Understanding which properties are owned by the same individuals or organizations.
